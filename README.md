# goLangZillow

This is a fun side project I am doing to learn and better unstand Go.

The purpose is to create and send API requests to Zillow.com to gather information related to housing in a specific region. Project is still in progress, I will add more
detail here in the future. 

Requirements:

- Must have Go installed
- Must install fyne.io

Current State:

- The app currently works by allowing users to select a city in which they would like to see results from, from there, they will be displayed with the results.
