# goLangZillow

This is a fun side project I am doing to learn and better unstand Go.

The purpose is to create and send API requests to Zillow.com to gather information related to housing in a specific region. Project is still in progress, I will add more
detail here in the future. 

The data is then outputed to a website houstided on localhost:5505 which can be accessed from the browser

-Currently there are only four locations, once I figure out the UI I would like to go with I will add more locations
-The UI is created with the use of HTML, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for styling. 
-The data is stored in a json file, for actual deployment the database should, and could easily be put onto a NoSQL server, as a file is not practical and can lead to long
  operation times as it grows. 
- I am working on adding a pie chart to display the housing type make up of each region, and want to create a trends page for each region that displays
  charts of the current market trends for the area. But this may take some times as I need to collect more data.
