# goLangZillow

This is a fun side project I am doing to learn and better unstand Go.

The purpose is to create and send API requests to Zillow.com to gather information related to housing in a specific region. Project is still in progress, I will add more
detail here in the future. 

The data is then outputed to a website houstided on localhost:5505 which can be accessed from the browser

Requirements:

- Must have Go installed
